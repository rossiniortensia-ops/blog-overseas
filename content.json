{"posts":[{"title":"Celebrating National Day — Together for Our Motherland","text":"The Splendor of the Land and the Joy of Celebration — Written on the Eve of National Day 🎉🇨🇳As autumn breezes sweep across the vast land of China and the morning glow paints the mountains in red, we once again welcome a meaningful moment — October 1st, National Day, the birthday of the People’s Republic of China. On this day, no special ceremony is needed — the feeling of patriotism quietly rises in every heart. Look around: on the bustling city streets, the Five-Star Red Flags wave proudly under the golden sun; in peaceful villages, crimson flags flutter above smoke curling from chimneys — humble but heartfelt signs of joy. Shop windows glow with “China Red” decorations, children wave little flags, and social media overflows with “I love you, China.” These small yet heartwarming moments come together to form the ritual beauty of this festival, turning “National Day” from a date on the calendar into a shared emotional memory for every Chinese person. We often say that National Day is more than a holiday — it is a mirror that lets us look back at history. It reminds us of the solemn declaration over 70 years ago: “The Central People’s Government of the People’s Republic of China is established!” It recalls generations of hard work and perseverance that carried the nation from poverty to prosperity. At the same time, it is also a beacon of the future, reminding us that today’s peace and comfort are built upon the sweat and dedication of countless people — and that the journey toward a better tomorrow continues with our shared efforts. On this glorious and hopeful day, there is so much to say from the heart: Gratitude to our Motherland, whose strength provides us a safe and stable home. From border defense to daily life, from technological breakthroughs to social progress — it is the steady rise of our nation that gives us the confidence to stand tall in the world and pursue happiness fearlessly. Gratitude for everyday life, where beauty hides in simplicity — a warm breakfast at dawn, a cozy dinner with family, the convenience of travel, a peaceful walk in the park. These small joys are threads in the fabric of happiness, reminding us that “when the country prospers, the people thrive.” Hope for growing with our nation — though we may be ordinary individuals in our roles, every bit of hard work, every act of kindness, every moment of diligence contributes to the nation’s progress. May we all paint our own stories on the canvas of our era, walking alongside our country toward a brighter future. Finally, let us offer our sincerest blessings — to our beloved country, and to everyone striving for a better life: 🎆 May our Motherland remain splendid and prosperous for generations to come. May you have a joyful and peaceful National Day filled with happiness and strength! 🎆","link":"/91327/"},{"title":"The Origin and Blessings of the Mid-Autumn Festival","text":"🌕 The Origin and Blessings of the Mid-Autumn FestivalThe Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival or Mooncake Festival, is one of China’s four major traditional holidays.

Eighty years ago at this moment, after 14 years of bloody struggle, the Chinese people finally welcomed the great victory of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. Meanwhile, the world anti-fascist alliance fought side by side, completely crushing the aggressive ambitions of fascism and letting the dawn of peace shine again on the land devastated by war. Looking back at those years of broken mountains and rivers, stormy times, the Chinese people, under extremely harsh conditions, with the national integrity of “better to be broken jade than intact tile,” used their flesh and blood to build the Great Wall against foreign invasion. From the great victory at Pingxingguan that broke the myth of “Japanese invincibility,” to the Hundred Regiments Offensive that boosted national morale; from countless martyrs’ heroic “sacrificing lives for the country, viewing death as homecoming,” to hundreds of millions of people’s perseverance of “one inch of mountains and rivers, one inch of blood; one hundred thousand youths, one hundred thousand soldiers” — we exchanged the dignity of national independence with the tremendous sacrifice of 35 million compatriots, and made indelible contributions to the victory of the world anti-fascist war. Remembering this history has never been about perpetuating hatred, but about drawing strength from suffering and safeguarding peace through commemoration. Today’s national peace and tranquil years are the “hard-won” gift exchanged by countless martyrs with their lives. In this happiness lies the belief we must uphold: Peace is the most precious gift. Having experienced the ravages of war, we better understand the value of tranquility. Every ordinary day of stable life is a treasure that we need to cherish and defend with action, tolerating no slack or carelessness. History is the spiritual backbone of the nation. Those heroic stories engraved in mountains and rivers, the spirit of resistance flowing in our bloodline, are the confidence for the Chinese nation to weather storms and forge ahead. Forgetting history equals severing the spiritual genes of the nation; remembering history keeps the nation’s backbone forever upright. Self-strengthening is the foundation for safeguarding the future. The victory 80 years ago tells us that only through unity and self-improvement can we resist risks and control our destiny. Today, we need to learn from history, strive in our respective positions, and use national prosperity and national rejuvenation to build a solid foundation for peace, making the bright future increasingly stable through generations. Eighty years have passed, mountains and rivers have taken on a new appearance, but the echoes of that history have never faded. Let us move forward with commemoration for martyrs, cherishing peace, and expectations for the future — with the youth of our generation, protecting prosperous China, letting the torch of peace pass on forever, and the spirit of the nation continue through generations. 🕯️ Let us jointly remember history, pay tribute to heroes, cherish peace, and create a better future! 🕊️","link":"/13399/"}],"tags":[{"name":"National Day","slug":"National-Day","link":"/tags/National-Day/"},{"name":"Festival","slug":"Festival","link":"/tags/Festival/"},{"name":"Mid-Autumn Festival","slug":"Mid-Autumn-Festival","link":"/tags/Mid-Autumn-Festival/"},{"name":"Chinese Festival","slug":"Chinese-Festival","link":"/tags/Chinese-Festival/"},{"name":"Moon Culture","slug":"Moon-Culture","link":"/tags/Moon-Culture/"},{"name":"Reunion","slug":"Reunion","link":"/tags/Reunion/"},{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","link":"/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"GitHub","slug":"GitHub","link":"/tags/GitHub/"},{"name":"Deployment","slug":"Deployment","link":"/tags/Deployment/"},{"name":"Tutorial","slug":"Tutorial","link":"/tags/Tutorial/"},{"name":"Python","slug":"Python","link":"/tags/Python/"},{"name":"VSCode","slug":"VSCode","link":"/tags/VSCode/"},{"name":"IDE","slug":"IDE","link":"/tags/IDE/"},{"name":"PyCharm","slug":"PyCharm","link":"/tags/PyCharm/"},{"name":"Jupyter","slug":"Jupyter","link":"/tags/Jupyter/"},{"name":"Editor","slug":"Editor","link":"/tags/Editor/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","link":"/tags/Blogging/"},{"name":"GitHub Pages","slug":"GitHub-Pages","link":"/tags/GitHub-Pages/"},{"name":"welcome","slug":"welcome","link":"/tags/welcome/"},{"name":"introduction","slug":"introduction","link":"/tags/introduction/"},{"name":"tech blog","slug":"tech-blog","link":"/tags/tech-blog/"},{"name":"Anti-Japanese War Memorial Day","slug":"Anti-Japanese-War-Memorial-Day","link":"/tags/Anti-Japanese-War-Memorial-Day/"},{"name":"History","slug":"History","link":"/tags/History/"},{"name":"Peace","slug":"Peace","link":"/tags/Peace/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Essay","slug":"Essay","link":"/categories/Essay/"},{"name":"Traditional Culture","slug":"Traditional-Culture","link":"/categories/Traditional-Culture/"},{"name":"Python","slug":"Python","link":"/categories/Python/"},{"name":"Blog Tutorial","slug":"Blog-Tutorial","link":"/categories/Blog-Tutorial/"},{"name":"General","slug":"General","link":"/categories/General/"},{"name":"Essays","slug":"Essays","link":"/categories/Essays/"},{"name":"Tool Recommendations","slug":"Python/Tool-Recommendations","link":"/categories/Python/Tool-Recommendations/"}],"pages":[{"title":"About","text":"About MeHi there! 👋 Welcome to my tech blog!
